# Grade-11-DissolvingSpeed-and-CalculatingSpeedOfString
Program has two parts:
    The first part opens up to a model that lets the user change the temperature and observe the effects
on the dissolving speed of solute particles in a beaker of solvent (water).
    The second part opens up to a model of a guitar that vibrates in one loop, and based on what the user
sets as the length (cm) of the guitar string and at what frequency (Hz) the string vibrates at, the program
will determine the speed of the string.
